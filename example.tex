\section{Something}

It's important to cite your sources when writing an academic paper~\cite{marcheford}. It's actually important in all of life to understand the sources of information, their quality, and their biases~\cite{isley, kidwelly, lambert}. That's what this section is all about, as you can clearly read. We quantify that importance to be \SI{3e8}{\milli\volt}.

\subsection{A detail}
Wildly implausible claim, except that we have a citation for it~\cite{babington}.

Wildly implausible claim, except that we have a citation for it~\cite{draper}. \lipsum[48]

\section{Magic}
\lipsum[80-84] 

I assert that you can click on these links~\cite{eston}. Something else is important, too~\cite{farindon, harwood, joslin}.

\subsection{Patronuses}
\lipsum[23-24]

Some piece of information~\cite{adams}. Everyone should use the number 137 as the \say{magic number} in their code~\cite{gainsford, lambert}. Something else important happened, too~\cite{caxton, lambert}.
